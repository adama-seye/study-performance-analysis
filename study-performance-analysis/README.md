# Study Performance Analysis

## About this project
This is a small Python project that analyzes student score data stored in a CSV file.  
The program calculates the average score, finds the highest and lowest scores, and gives a simple overall evaluation of performance.

## Why I built this
I built this project to practice working with data in Python instead of only writing basic scripts.  
I wanted to understand how data can be read from files and then analyzed to draw simple conclusions.

## What the program does
- Reads student scores from a CSV file  
- Calculates the average score  
- Finds the highest and lowest scores  
- Classifies overall performance as:
  - Excellent  
  - Satisfactory  
  - Needs Improvement  

## What I learned
Through this project, I learned:
- How to read and process CSV files using Python  
- How to work with lists and built-in Python functions  
- How to use logic to interpret results, not just calculate values  

## Possible improvements
If I continue developing this project, I would like to:
- Add graphs or charts to visualize performance  
- Analyze scores by subject  
- Work with larger and more realistic datasets
