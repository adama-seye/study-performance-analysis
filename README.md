## Study Performance Analysis

This project analyzes the UCI Student Performance dataset to identify which academic and socio-demographic factors most strongly influence students' final grades.

### Methods
- Data cleaning and exploration using Pandas
- Correlation analysis with Seaborn heatmaps
- Linear regression modeling with Scikit-Learn

### Key Insight
Early-term grades (G1, G2) were stronger predictors of final performance than study time alone.

### Dataset
UCI Machine Learning Repository – Student Performance Dataset

The analysis shows that early-term academic performance (G1, G2) has a significantly stronger correlation with final grades than study time alone, suggesting that early intervention may be more effective than increased workload later.
